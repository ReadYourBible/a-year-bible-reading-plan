# A Year Bible Reading Plan

This repository contains a structured Bible reading plan divided into 365 folders—one for each day of the calendar year. The plan guides readers through the entire Bible in daily readings of approximately 15 minutes.

## Repository Structure

- Each folder is named `day-001`, `day-002`, ..., up to `day-365`.
- Inside each folder, there is a single file (e.g., `reading.md`) that lists the Bible chapters assigned for that day.
- The reading order goes from Genesis to Revelation, following a mostly sequential pattern.
- The plan includes the entire Old and New Testaments, Psalms, Proverbs, and all major and minor prophets.

## Purpose

This plan is ideal for individuals, families, or groups who want to read through the entire Bible in one year. With daily portions designed to be completed in approximately 15 minutes, it offers a sustainable, consistent devotional rhythm.

## How to Use
